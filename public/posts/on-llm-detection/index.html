	<meta name="description" content="Introduction
You&rsquo;ve probably heard of AI text detectors such as gptzero and so on. You&rsquo;ve
also probably heard that their accuracy tends to be very low. If you&rsquo;ve
ever been interested in finding out how exactly these detectors tick and
how accurate they can really be then you&rsquo;re in luck. Communications of the ACM
published an article late last year surveying the common methods used in detecting
llm-generated text. I found the article extremely fascinating and desperately needed
to share it someone, by someone I meant the hopeless nerds reading this right now.
This is just going to be an abridged version highlighting the sections I found really
colourful supplemented with some additional reading. I highly recommend you read
the original article." />

<p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard of AI text detectors such as gptzero and so on. You&rsquo;ve
also probably heard that their accuracy tends to be very low. If you&rsquo;ve
ever been interested in finding out how exactly these detectors tick and
how accurate they can really be then you&rsquo;re in luck. <em>Communications of the ACM</em>
published an article late last year surveying the common methods used in detecting
llm-generated text. I found the article extremely fascinating and desperately needed
to share it someone, by someone I meant the hopeless nerds reading this right now.

<h2 id="black-box-methods">Black Box Methods</h2>
<p>Black box methods focus on analyzing output and classifying them based on
criteria.</p>
<h2 id="white-box-methods">White Box Methods</h2>
<p>white box methods mostly revolve around creating some sort of watermark to
identify llm-generated text. Creating this watermark is pretty tricky as it
needs to be resistant to paraphrasing while being difficult to detect without
prior knowledge and trivial to verify.</p>
<p>Just implanting certain words into the llm output isn&rsquo;t good enough as that&rsquo;s pretty
easy to change just by using synonym words.</p>
<p>Inference-time watermarking is really cool. It basically divides words that
could be output by the LLM into good and bad lists. The model then only
uses words from the &lsquo;allowed&rsquo; list. In order to check the watermark, the
detector checks the frequency of the words in the &lsquo;banned&rsquo; list. This didn&rsquo;t seem
particular helpful at first but when you think about it, you see that it&rsquo;s not
very likely that a piece of work would seem to avoid certain phrases. You also have
to be very careful with how many words are in the banned list as it could negatively
impact the qualify of the output.</p>
<p>Another method, that I found rather interesting was using the text&rsquo;s syntactic structure.</p>
